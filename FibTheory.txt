*********************Fib Theory*******************

Overview:

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,........
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
With seed values
F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
The function recursive_fibonacci takes an integer n as input and calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.



code:

recursive_fibonacci function:

This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
If the input n is 0 or 1, it returns n itself, representing the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.
If n is greater than 1, it recursively calls the recursive_fibonacci function for (n-1) and (n-2), summing the results to compute the Fibonacci number for n.
nonrecursive_fibonacci function:

This function calculates the Fibonacci sequence in a non-recursive or iterative manner.
It initializes first and second variables to 0 and 1 respectively (representing the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence).
It prints the values of first and second.
It enters a while loop that continues until n - 2 becomes less than or equal to 0.
Within this loop:
It calculates the third Fibonacci number by adding the first and second numbers.
It shifts the values: first becomes the previous value of second, and second becomes the newly calculated third.
It prints the value of the newly calculated third.
It decrements n by 1.
main section:

It prompts the user to input a number (n).
It then prints "Recursive" and tries to iterate over a range from 0 to n, calling the recursive_fibonacci(i) function in each iteration. This code part might throw an error as the recursive_fibonacci function is not designed to handle iterations in this manner.
After the "Recursive" print loop, it prints "Non Recursive" and calls the nonrecursive_fibonacci function, passing the input n.
